## 🙏 Credits & Inspiration
This project was heavily inspired by **[PedroMachadoYT]** and his open-source React portfolio design.  
As a beginner in **React** and **JavaScript**, I learned a lot from studying his structure, component organization, and UI animations.  
I customized and expanded upon his layout to better reflect my own experiences and career path.
